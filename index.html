            <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Divine figures such as Vishnu and Shiva in Hinduism, or the Buddha in Buddhism are integral to many South Asian religions. Often being practitioners’ devotional focus, the relationships humans build with these figures are deeply personal and a central part of these cultures. These relationships reflect practitioners’ beliefs, values, and aspirations, the effects of which are captured throughout devotional poetry, iconography, and stories passed down through generations. This website explores such stories and literature to show how divinity helps people make sense of what it means to be human specifically through the lens of Hinduism.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 50px;">The Tevaram is a collection of devotional poems dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva, highlighting his divine power and grandness. Many of the poems in this collection demonstrate an intense personal connection with the god, tackling themes of love, surrender, and the challenges of human existence. The poem entitled <i>The Lord Is Sweet</i>, for example, celebrates Shiva’s kindness and beauty and the author’s commitment to him, using metaphors such as “Innampar’s Lord whos it the breath of life, which enters and leaves me, and abides with.” On the other hand, the poem <i>Pain and Grace</i> explores the challenges and hardships that come with a deep connection to Shiva, portraying him as a divine force who tests and transforms his devotees through both suffering and mercy. Both ultimately show how Shiva serves as a guide who helps his devotees navigate the ups and downs of life, finding meaning and solace within themselves through him.</p>

        <div class="row summary-text">
          <p>While many narratives portray the Goddess of Hinduism in a similar light to how Shiva is described in the Tevaram, this narrative serves a different purpose. In this story, a king who wanted children attempted to sacrifice a human to the Goddess to fulfill his wish. After the sacrificial victim escaped, the king’s attendants kidnapped another person to take his place. As they were preparing him for the sacrifice, the goddess realized what was happening and took action. Enraged by the greedy and murderous intent of the men performing the sacrifice, she took on a terrifying demon-like form and murdered all of them, going as far as to drink their blood as it streamed from their necks. Although this story depicts a more benevolent side of the Goddess, it provides moral guidelines that humans should follow unless they want to face her wrath.</p>

          <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Upon receiving powers that made him nearly invincible, the powerful demon-king Hiranyakashipu proclaimed himself as a god and demanded that people in his kingdom worship him as such. His son Prahlada however becomes deeply devoted to Lord Vishnu despite multiple attempts to intervene by his dad. Infuriated, Hiranyakashipu orders the death of his son, though Prahlada miraculously survives multiple attempts at his life, a result of his unwavering devotion. The arrogant King then tries to kill his son himself but meets his end as Vishnu, taking the form of a half-man, half-lion, steps in to protect Prahlada. This story captures both the benevolent and malevolent aspects of divine figures. Having faith in them can bring protection and guidance in life such as in the case of Prahlada. Opposing them on the other hand can lead to facing their divine wrath and destruction as shown in the death of Hiranyakashipu.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="row summary-text">
          <p style="text-indent: 50px;"> Upon analyzing these different texts/stories, the role that divine figures play in helping humans make sense of their existence becomes clear. Fostering a connection with the divine imbues moral guidelines for which humans can gracefully live out their lives even through the toughest of times. While these entities can invoke a sense of fear and humans may never be able to comprehend their sheer power, they can find solace in that devotion to them can grant divine protection, virtuousness, and prosperity. This benevolent aspect of the divine is present in the way that the poets of the Tevaram describe Shiva, and how Vishnu protects Prahlad from being harmed by his father. From these stories, it is clear that humans can find comfort and refuge with the Divine through faith. Those who oppose the divine however are subject to their divine wrath/justice. The group of thieves in the narrative about the Goddess, for instance, faced her retribution for greedily sacrificing people which she found despicable. Another example would be Heranyakashipu meeting his end due to his arrogance and disrespect to Vishnu. These types of depictions demonstrate how these beings are in a league of their own above humankind. Understanding this difference in power and choosing to devote one’s self to these divine figures, living under the guidelines they provide for a prosperous life, is what it means to be human. </p>
